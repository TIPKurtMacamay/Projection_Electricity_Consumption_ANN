The Department of Energy (DOE) states that natural gas is at 5.5%, oil is at 34.6 percent, and coal is at 37.1 percent, making up the majority of the energy supply. However, 22.8 percent of energy comes from renewable sources, primarily hydropower, biofuels, solar energy, and wind.

Coal and gas prices are expected to stay high in 2023, according to Joseph Nocos, vice president of business development at Alsons Power, since there is no end in sight to the Ukrainian crisis. 

Increased use of renewable energy sources for the production of electricity is the goal of a policy mechanism under the RE ACT. A certain percentage of the power supply must come from eligible renewable energy sources, according to the requirement placed on electricity suppliers, especially distribution utilities. The DOE has also granted preferential dispatch status in the wholesale electricity spot market (WESM) to all eligible and registered renewable energy generating plants. This action is perceived to hasten the growth and application of domestic renewable energy resources.

## **The Solution**

The project aims to focus on developing a web application for Electricity Consumption using Artificial Neural Network. ANNs are a family of machine learning models that are modeled after the neural architecture of the human brain. These models have shown to be particularly good at recognizing complicated patterns and making precise predictions. This web-based system uses ANN to predict electricity consumption since it is common in the field of Machine Learning or AI. The project aims to provide citizens and companies with a reliable and efficient energy delivery, not just to increase operational efficiency.
